# Add attributes to external links - Nera plugin
This is a tiny plugin which will add attributes to all the  
links in your content where the url starts with _http_ or _www_.

## Usage
To use this plugin just add it to your `/src/plugins` folder. It should work out  
of the box.  
In addition to the already added attribute `target="_blank"` you could add more  
attributes like `class` etc. to the `config/link-attribute.yaml` file. They will  
be added as well.
